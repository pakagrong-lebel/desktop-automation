Identifying Tasks for Automation
I first needed to identify which tasks could benefit from automation. After some careful consideration, I came up with the below list of tasks:

Removing duplicate files, such as those with similar names (e.g., img.png, img(1).png, img(2).png), and saving the most recent version while deleting the rest.
Removing temporary files that are no longer needed, such as log files, screenshots, cache files, and installation files.
Cleaning up the Downloads folder by organizing files by file type or moving them to designated folders.
Removing old/unused applications that are taking up valuable storage space.
